    "This notebook explains how you can use a transformer model. Transformer models are published regularly on the huggingface platform: https://huggingface.co/models\n",
    "\n",
    "These models are very big (Gigabytes) and require a computer with sufficient memory to load. Furthermore, loading these models takes some time as well. It is also possible to copy such a model to your disk and to load the local copy. Still a substantial memory is needed to load it."

    "There is whole family of transformer models developed by different research groups and published on the Huggingface platform. We will look at two popular models BERT and its sequel RoBERTa, specifically its crosslingual variant XML-RoBERTa.\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformers model pretrained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. This means it was pretrained on the raw texts only, without human labelling. BERT was pretrained with two objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Masked language modeling (MLM): taking a sentence, the model randomly masks 15% of the words in the input. It next runs the entire masked sentence through the model to predict the masked words. This is different from traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that usually see the words one after the other, or from autoregressive models like GPT which only mask the future/next tokens. BERT allows the model to learn a bidirectional representation of the sentence.\n",
    "* Next sentence prediction (NSP): the model concatenates two masked sentences as input during pretraining. Sometimes they correspond to sentences that were following each other in the original text (positive example), sometimes it is a random sentence (negative example). The model then has to predict if the two sentences were following each other or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core trick of the model is **Attention**, hence the seminal paper \"Attention is all you need\" (Vaswani et al 2017). Attention refers to the principle that the embedding representation of a word or token in a sequence is determined for the purpose of e.g. predicting the masked tokens but with the help of the other tokens. Likewise, the model learns which words in the context pay most attention to the role of predicting masked words. This is applied to all words in a sequence and over many (11 to more than 20) layers with different attention heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually running many times over large amounts of data, the models learn an inner representation of the English language (a language model) that can then be used to represent sentences in texts as contextual vectors in downstream tasks, instead of feature engineered vectors. If you have a dataset of labeled sentences for instance, you can train a standard classifier using the representations produced by the BERT model as inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "RoBERTa is a more efficient sequel to BERT in which the next sentence prediction was dropped, more data, more layers and wider contexts were used (Liu et al 2019). It often gives better performance than BERT in downstream tasks but it is bigger and more heavy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "XLM-RoBERTa is a multilingual version of RoBERTa. It is pre-trained on 2.5TB of filtered CommonCrawl data containing 100 languages (Lample and Conneau 2019). XLM-RoBERTa can represent text in any of these languages and it can be finetuned in one language (or more) and applied to all these languages. This makes it possible to profit from the English training data that is available for all languages captured by the model even if there is no labeled data in that specific language.\n",

    "We will start with the English case-sensitive BERT model that is provided by the Huggingface platform. It is possible to load the model itself in combination with its tokenizer to get a representation of a text for all words/tokens across all layers. It is however rather complex to exploit these representations for specific tasks. Huggingface therefore provides an option to create a pipeline to perform an NLP task with a pretrained model:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The pipelines are a great and easy way to use models for inference. These pipelines are objects that abstract most of the complex code from the library, offering a simple API dedicated to several tasks, including Named Entity Recognition, Masked Language Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, Feature Extraction and Question Answering.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "More information can be found here: https://huggingface.co/transformers/v3.0.2/main_classes/pipelines.html\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find information on the different tasks and how to call these. We will use these pipelines in this class for a gentle introduction. In notebook 4.3, will use the pipeline module to load fine-tuned models to perform sentiment analysis and emotion detection. In notebook 4.4, we try out finetuned crosslingual models."
